Bread. What a funny way of saying wetted dust speckled with rat pellets...the rat pellets from our beloved pets, Chikadee and Mousilini...they took the other paper shoe and flied away in the rain..like those sweet magnolias oh those sweet magnolias. oh what i wouldnt give to taste the sweltering buds on my tounge, drink their sweet nectar with my mama once more...the rocking horse seemed to have broken because the magnolias rain down no more..not since mama left anyway. Again the same words filling my head filling with dread how I could never beat the man and find me dead those walls those walls all filled with lead and shove me hard against the sawderwood tarp. the man who started the storm..the man who took my mama and shoved her lithe figure into the paper shoe and tossed her out into the world...he gave her neither a proper coat nor hat for her journy, and showed me no remorse as he stole our ice skates and ran off into the night..Oh god to drink the oil to drink the blood to slit the juice from the tigers loins, i can only survive the cold by damning him to hell. Shatter the wall. Shatter the patriarchy. the tiger used to be a friend of mine....her juices kept me and mama fed for weeks when we couldnt afford to go to chip and derries diner anymore.. And what is a chip and what is a derrie and when can the women be freed from her shackles and yet, I find myself willing and chilling and grilling the robins eggs. Reap what you sew. reap what you sew..and sew what you reap. my mama always gave me a new spring coat for when the devil came and tried to lay his hands on our family...the coat would keep him away, but only for 16.5 minutes until the coat disinigrated because it was made out of hay. How can the nourishment of such abashed creatures rob itself of the benounced pleasure of partaking in the basket of the soul. The soul. The soul. I am whole. Am i whole? but a whole is not to a half. a half not to a whole orange on my birthday from the tree i longed to see. oranges...mama planted an  orange tree out yonder past the valley when i was a smudgen. she told me id be just like ht etree when i grew up if i planted my seeds right. i wanted to turn orange too, so i painted myself with my mamas make-up until i was as tan as the summer desert. Oh to be so blind, to need, to greed, to feed off of the hooves of that orange devil. So handsome in his grapefruit petticoats. his seeds were not as pure as my mamas once were, although he plucked them out and polished them every night.. he was richer than me, and stronger too. he could tame the tiger.
So strong so wrong so wrong so tethered in fact that he could not recognize his own toe jam in the mirror that he sketched. No longer cradled by my mother, the search continued. I tried to find. I tried to fight, but yet my ye old ankles could only support the longing terror of my bloodline. his mirror was dirty and cracked... mine was pristine like the waters of birth. blood spilled into the waters when my mama left, a river a of red. The red river. Sounds familiar. The red river of boiling blood rushing through my veins as i killed the last body of venison deep in the woods. She may find herself washed up and slithering in the endless bucket of toe jam, but its in the hands of the paper shoe now. So far the tar i rub the soot the ash the ash its all too familar. the proper shoe... a hard, wooden, leahter, glass shoe. paper is flimsy, gets carried away with a storm if your not careful. the ash coated mamas lungs for years when she inhaled sticks of nicotine and ate the shell when she was done. I saw. I saw, I fought, I conquered..... In my dreams. One can dream of the soft cloud of nicotine grandpappy once blew in my cool face as he kissed me goodnight with his cold, dead, lips. Those lips know many things, such is the case when the key to the lock is no longer guarded by the feminine grip of a Putto. the Putto came to me in a dream... told me how my mama was faring in the storm. she was frozen, he said, gripping onto her paper shoe, her eyelids crusted open with the sweet sprinklings of snow. he told me i had to find the key. grandpappys lips were the only ones who knew, but they were long gone, like two dried worms in a tomato gardne. The garden I always saw as a representation of me. When the yearly barrel winds came... Poof. I was gone with the wind.... as my mother came sailing back on her paper shoe.
